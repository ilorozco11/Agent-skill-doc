## Sample Use Cases

### Startup Building MVP
**Goal:** Rapid feature development with limited team
**Recommended Skills:** Code generation, documentation, testing
**Timeline:** Start with Phase 1, expand after MVP launch

### Enterprise Modernizing Legacy System
**Goal:** Refactor 15-year-old monolith
**Recommended Skills:** Refactoring, documentation, testing, architecture
**Timeline:** Comprehensive 18-month program with all phases

### High-Security Financial Application
**Goal:** Payment processing with zero security tolerance
**Recommended Skills:** Security analysis, code review, testing
**Timeline:** Security-first approach with cautious code generation

## Key Principles

1. **Match Skills to Pain Points** - Focus on solving real problems, not adopting technology for its own sake
2. **Respect Team Readiness** - Culture and mindset matter more than technical capability
3. **Maintain Quality Standards** - AI accelerates development but doesn't replace judgment
4. **Measure and Iterate** - Data-driven decisions with regular feedback loops
5. **Think Long-Term** - Build organizational learning alongside tool adoption

## Implementation Phases
